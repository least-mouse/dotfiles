# dotfiles
dotfiles and stuff i need to reinstall my arch linux install

## instructions
like copy everything into the home directory
and then like idk man, run the package install script (stuff is missing)

p.s. I'm so sorry if somebody needs to use this for something this was made entirely for my own benefit
