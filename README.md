# dotfiles
dotfiles and stuff i need to reinstall my arch linux install

## notes
there may be some whack shit so like if something breaks check that stuff

## instructions
like copy everything into the home directory
and then like idk man, run the package install script

p.s. I'm so sorry if somebody needs to use this for something this was made entirely for my own benefit
